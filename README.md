TODO:

* Create djr account?

* Should I use my standard ssh keys after initial provisioning?
* Look into how to make sshd more secure
* Improve OpenVPN security - MITM attack
* Improve IPTables security - IPV6

* Lock down ntp hosts in iptables
* Lock down sendgrid smtp hosts

* Try iPhone OpenVPN app
* Make Dropwall not log traffic. Also do not log ssh attempts
